# Chat with PDF using Free LLM API and Streamlit

## Overview

This project is a proof-of-concept web application that allows users to chat with the contents of a PDF document using a language model. The application uses Anyscale’s free LLM API to generate responses based on user queries about the PDF content. The interface is built using Streamlit.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- PyPDF2 or pdfminer
- Requests

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/BeleRohit/chatty-patty.git>
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Obtain an Anyscale API key:**
   - Sign up for a free API key from Anyscale at [https://www.anyscale.com/](https://www.anyscale.com/).
   - Store the API key in an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export ANYSCALE_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'  # On Windows, use `set ANYSCALE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`
     ```

## Usage Guide

### Running the Streamlit App

1. **Start the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Upload a PDF file:**
   - Use the file uploader in the Streamlit interface to upload the PDF document you want to chat with.

3. **Ask questions:**
   - Enter your query in the text input field and press Enter.
   - The app will display the relevant responses generated by the LLM based on the content of the PDF.

### Example Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app.
2. Upload a sample PDF document.
3. Ask questions like "What is the main topic of the document?" or "Can you summarize the first section?".
4. View the generated responses in the chat area.

## Approach and Design Decisions

### PDF Processing

- Used PyPDF2 to extract text from PDF files.
- Implemented basic text preprocessing to handle extra whitespace and line breaks.

### Language Model Integration

- Integrated with Anyscale’s free LLM API to generate responses to user queries.
- Implemented a method to match user queries with relevant parts of the PDF text.

### User Interface with Streamlit

- Created an interactive web application with Streamlit.
- Added components for file upload, text input, and chat display.
- Included basic error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

### Performance and Security Considerations

- Implemented basic caching to reduce redundant API calls for repeated or similar queries.
- Stored the Anyscale API key securely using environment variables.

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced PDF structure recognition to better understand headers and paragraphs.
- Add support for handling multiple PDF documents in a single session.
- Highlight relevant parts of the PDF text from which the responses are generated.
- Address common issues with LLMs, such as hallucinations, by implementing additional validation and correction mechanisms.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge:** Ensuring accurate text extraction from varied PDF formats.
  - **Solution:** Experimented with multiple PDF extraction libraries and preprocessing techniques to handle different formats effectively.
- **Challenge:** Efficiently matching user queries with relevant PDF content.
  - **Solution:** Developed a heuristic-based matching method to align queries with the most relevant parts of the text.
